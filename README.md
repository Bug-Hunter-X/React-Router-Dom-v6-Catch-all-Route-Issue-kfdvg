This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router v6.  The problem occurs when the catch-all route unintentionally intercepts requests intended for other, more specific routes.  The solution provided shows how to correctly order routes to avoid this conflict.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.
